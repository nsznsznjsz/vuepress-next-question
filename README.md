# Question

[Question Here](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-next/discussions/40)

Steps:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nsznsznjsz/vuepress-next-question.git
cd vuepress-next-question
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

We can see a vuepress website with default theme, and only a green box (3 boxs actually).

However, I have changed the theme [here](https://github.com/nsznsznjsz/vuepress-next-question/blob/main/src/.vuepress/config.ts#L12), but it doesn't seem to work.
