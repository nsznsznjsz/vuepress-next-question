# Question

[Question Here](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-next/discussions/40)

Steps:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nsznsznjsz/vuepress-next-question.git
cd vuepress-next-question
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser. We can see a vuepress website and only green box (3 boxs actually).

However, red box (with index.css) and yellow box (with componment) didn't show up, I guess `clientAppEnhence.ts` does not compile to js, how can I got it?
